Oh, peculiar little creature! You're back!

Five Pebbles has informed me of your visit. It appears he was not too pleased with your art, painted<LINE>over his pristine chamber walls. He is quite strict about keeping his place clean, you see.

I apologize for being the cause of your unfortunate situation, it was not my intention to make you the<LINE>target of his wrath.

He can get irritable sometimes, but I'm sure he wouldn't hurt anyone unprovoked. He's like a younger<LINE>brother to me, so please don't take his lashing out at you too seriously.

When I asked you to share your artistic abilities, I did not mean for you to paint over his puppet<LINE>chamber. During ancient times my creators would put their art over fabric canvas or places designed<LINE>for it.

Unfortunately, Five Pebbles does not encourage what he perceives as vandalism, which is painting in<LINE>places not intended for it. I personally do not mind you painting over my facility walls, as not much<LINE>will come of that space anyway. They might as well work as canvas for something new.

Your art, however, reminds me of our creators. It is truly astounding that you were able to replicate<LINE>it so well. I'm sure that once Five Pebbles sees how wonderful my structure, or at least structures<LINE>far enough away from his, looks with your decorations, he will come around and enjoy your presence more?

...Ah. I have something to tell you as well.

0 : While you were away, I managed to find information on the elements of the outfit that you are currently<LINE>wearing. If you are interested in such historical information, I could tell you. : 60 

Do you know what a purposed organism is? You are talking to one right now, and you are likely a<LINE>descendant of one of them as well!

Your ancestors were likely created with the sole purpose of cleaning the insides of pipes, although<LINE>that was not all that they were used for. Some of my citizens took a liking to them and kept them as<LINE>companions instead, giving them various outfits and titles.

It appears to me the shoes that you wear were a part of such apparel, and are actually composed of<LINE>purposed organisms themselves!

I will spare you the details, but your current apparel works on the base of magnetism, allowing for<LINE>quick travel on any smooth metal surface.

As for the glasses you wear, they were for the many of your kind who did not enjoy wearing masks but<LINE>needed ocular protection from the sun. Your style was most likely sold at clearance emporiums, but don't<LINE>worry - they suit you perfectly!~

Oh... I did not mean to speak for so long. You may leave now, although I do not mind your company.<LINE>Stay as long as you would like, little creature.
