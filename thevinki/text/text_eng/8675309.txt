Oh, funny little creature! You're back!

I received a message from Five Pebbles about your visit. It appears that he was not too<LINE>pleased with your art. I'm sorry that my idea to surprise him got you in trouble.

He can get irritable sometimes, but I'm sure he wouldn't hurt anyone unprovoked. He's<LINE>like a younger brother to me, so please don't take his lashing out at you too seriously.

The reason I suggested that you show him your art is because he is very interested in our<LINE>creators' history, and your art reminds me of some of theirs! I wonder how you were able<LINE>to replicate their style so well? He must be wondering too, as angry as he seemed to you.

If you create some more art around our facility grounds, he may come around to you. I am<LINE>sure that he can only hold back his historical enthusiasm for so long!

0 : Oh! While you were away, I searched through my memory banks about the shoes that you are<LINE>wearing. If you are also interested in my creators' history, as well as your species's, I<LINE>can tell you about them. : 60

My creators produced organisms that were purposed for various tasks, such as guards for us<LINE>Iterators, and microbes that can digest inorganic material. Your species was initially<LINE>created for the purpose of cleaning out their ventalation systems that could not be<LINE>reached otherwise.

However, some of my creators' took a liking to your species - likely because of your<LINE>intelligence and generally cute appearence. Many of my creators' began to bring you<LINE>into their homes as companions.

Soon enough, some of my creators began to fashion clothing for your species. Robes,<LINE>masks, and shoes were not all that uncommon for your kind to wear! 

The particular shoes you wear are actually composed of purposed organisms themselves. I<LINE>will spare you the details, but do you know what magnets are, little creature? Microbes<LINE>that make up the base of your shoes create an effect similar to magnets that allow for<LINE>quick traversal on metallic poles and beams.

As for the glasses you wear, they were for the many of your kind that did not enjoy<LINE>wearing masks but needed ocular protection from the sun. Your style was most likely<LINE>sold at clearence shops, but don't worry - they suit you perfectly!~

...

I feel sorry for all of the companions that returned home from work to find that all my<LINE>creators had vanished on that final day.

Stay for as long as you would like, little friend. Although I do not have anything else<LINE>to offer unfortunately.
