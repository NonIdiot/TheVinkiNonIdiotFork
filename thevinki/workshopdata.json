Jumping when going fast enough allows you to do a trick jump!\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/9EviGd5.gif[/img]\r\n\r\nYou can also grind vertical beams. Holding jump when you get to the top will result in a trick jump as well.\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/fOCUaI1.gif[/img]\r\n\r\nHold LB/L1/C to enter GRAFFITI MODE (you can change this button in Rain World\u0027s input settings) and then press pickup to spray a graffiti on the background!

He was a mischievous and artistic slugcat who had a knack for graffiti, and was inspired by the music he listen to from his RainPods(tm). Every wall, pipe, and surface in his vicinity became his canvas, as he painted vibrant murals that brought color to the gloomy world.\r\n\r\nHowever, The Vinki\u0027s life took a sad turn when he encountered Five Pebbles, a notorious and eccentric iterator known for his strict adherence to rules. It was an unfortunate meeting that forever changed The Vinki\u0027s perception of the world. Five Pebbles, in his unyielding quest for order, found one of The Vinki\u0027s graffiti pieces and decided to erase it with a single stroke of his overseer\u0027s laser.\r\n\r\nThe Vinki was devastated. His masterpiece was gone, reduced to mere dust. The pain of betrayal seeped deep into his slugcat soul. But he was determined to turn his sadness into something extraordinary.\r\n\r\nAs he wandered through the ruins and remnants of the Rain World, The Vinki stumbled upon a hidden alcove. Within it lay a forgotten artifact known as Soap shoes. These shoes were unlike anything he had ever seen before. They were infused with a long-lost technology that allowed the wearer to effortlessly grind rails and poles.\r\n\r\nThe Vinki saw this as a sign\u2014a chance to not only express himself through art but to also seek vengeance in a playful yet hilarious manner. With his newfound grinding abilities, he set out to create his most audacious and eye-catching graffiti pieces yet, leaving them in the most daring and impossible-to-reach places.\r\n\r\nFrom the tops of crumbling skyscrapers to the edges of perilous cliffs, The Vinki\u0027s art became a symbol of rebellion and resilience. He painted with passion, pouring his heart and soul into each stroke, defying the oppressive world around him.\r\n\r\nThe Rain World denizens, initially puzzled by The Vinki\u0027s antics, couldn\u0027t help but be both amused and awestruck. They laughed at the absurdity of seeing a slugcat grinding rails and poles, creating intricate art high above their heads. The Vinki\u0027s graffiti became a beacon of hope, reminding them that even in the darkest of times, there was still room for joy and laughter.\r\n\r\nAnd so, The Vinki, the sad yet funny slugcat, continued to roam the Rain World, leaving his mark wherever he could. He carried the pain of betrayal, but he channeled it into his art, inspiring others to find solace in their own creativity. The Vinki\u0027s saga taught the denizens of Rain World that even amidst sorrow, a little laughter and self-expression could bring about profound healing and transformation.\r\n\r\n[b][url=https://artfight.net/character/3448140.the-vinki-slugcat]Artfight link[/url][/b] \r\n\r\n[h1]To Do[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n    [*][strike]Grind in 0G[/strike]\r\n    [*][strike]Grind on vines[/strike]\r\n    [*][strike]Graffiti placement mechanic[/strike]\r\n    [*]Graffiti quest\r\n    [*]Story\r\n    [*]World design changes (moar grind rails, etc.)\r\n    [*]Art (for sleep screens, char select, etc.)\r\n    [*]Custom animations (grinding vertically, etc.)\r\n    [*]Trailer\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions or suggestions! You can also find me on Discord at [i]olaycolay[/i]\r\n\r\n[h1]Custom Art Instructions[/h1]\r\n[h2]In Game Graffiti[/h2]\r\nWhen you first start Rain World with The Vinki mod enabled, a new folder will appear in [i]Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/RainWorld_Data/StreamingAssets/decals[/i] called [i]VinkiGraffiti[/i]. There, you can upload pngs of graffitis you want to see, and remove the ones you don\u0027t!\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/of4EUPl.png[/img]\r\n\r\nIf you need to access Rain World\u0027s files, you can right-click the game in your Steam Library, then go to Manage \u003E Browse Local Files\r\n\r\n[h2]Slugcat Selection Screen Graffiti[/h2]\r\nThis is a bit more involved, so prepare thyself.\r\n[olist]\r\n    [*]Navigate to the mod\u0027s folder. It should be under [i]Steam\\steamapps\\workshop\\content\\312520\\3001275271[/i]\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/vrlz9e2.png[/img]\r\n\r\n    [*]Go into [i]scenes/slugcat - vinki[/i]\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/5EatpRd.png[/img]\r\n\r\n    [*][b]Optional[/b]: You can open Flat.png in a photo-editing program, then size your graffiti to fit on the wall. Save just that graffiti as a png with all of the extra whitespace and you\u0027ll get to skip adjusting it (in a much more painful way) later.\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/RNTwaXK.png[/img]\r\n\r\n    [*]Put your new graffiti there and rename it to [i]Graffiti - X[/i] where X is one number higher than the highest already in the folder\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/QycMuUj.png[/img]\r\n\r\n    [*]Almost done! Now go back to the mod folder and go into [i]slugbase\\scenes[/i]. Then open slugcat_vinki.json\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/KjJP08F.png[/img]\r\n\r\n    [*]Copy \u0026 paste one of the blocks for the graffiti images. Then, rename the pasted block to match your new graffiti. If you resized your image earlier, then you don\u0027t have to worry about changing the other parameters!\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/NOo9XQm.png[/img]\r\n\r\n    [*]You\u0027re done, congrats! Now you should see your graffiti eventually in Vinki\u0027s slugcat selection screen. Note that you should back your files up somewhere in case a future update messes with them.\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/MNKOnTF.png[/img]\r\n[/olist]\r\n\r\n[h1]Credits[/h1]\r\nThe legendary [i]cone._.lord[/i] (on Discord) for the Art!\r\nMy lovely gf for the name idea and help with the original color choices! \u003C3\r\nThe teams behind the mod\u0027s dependencies for making modding Rain World as painless and as fun of a process as possible!",
